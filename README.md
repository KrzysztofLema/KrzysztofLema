## 🌊 Outside of Development

When I’m not coding, you’ll often find me on the water or in the sky! I’m a **Yacht Skipper**, and one of my most memorable experiences was sailing on the **STS Pogoria**. This journey deepened my love for the sea and enhanced my leadership and teamwork skills, especially when navigating challenging conditions.

In addition to sailing, I’m currently working towards my **PPL(A) Pilot License**, a pursuit that connects with my passion for sailing and encompasses **Safety**, **Navigation**, **Meteorology**, **Aerodynamics**, and a lot more. The skills I develop in aviation—particularly in navigation and decision-making under pressure—complement my sailing experience and provide a well-rounded approach to problem-solving, whether in the air or on the water.

I am also a **PADI Rescue Diver**, which allows me to explore the underwater world. Diving has taught me patience, calmness, and adaptability—valuable traits I apply both in life and in my development work.

These passions for aviation, sailing, and diving shape my perspective and influence how I approach challenges in technology and life.

Feel free to connect with me if you're passionate about sailing, flying, diving, or tech – or better yet, all of the above! 🌊✈️🚤
